                <h2>How many people experience Hearing Loss?</h2>
                <p>Currently, <b>60%</b> of adults in Canada experience hearing loss. More notably, <b>78%</b> of Canada's seniors have measurable hearing loss.</p>

                <h2>How Hearing Loss affects us.</h2>
                <p>Hearing loss can make it difficult to communicate with others, which can lead to social isolation, misunderstandings, and frustration. This impacts daily life, and harms personal relationships. <u>It can cause anxiety and depression because of this social isolation and lead to dementia and Alzheimer's.</u><br><br>Hearing loss often causes seniors to withdraw from social events and spend more time at home. This can lead to <b>depression</b> resulting in worsening eating, sleeping and physical activity habits</p>
                
                <h2>Is there a cure for Hearing Loss?</h2>
                <p><b>90%</b> of people with hearing loss can improve their hearing, communication and quality of life through environmental changes, hearing aids, etc...</p>

                <h2>What causes Hearing Loss?</h2>
                <p>A prevalent issue that leads to a decline in hearing ability is caused by exposure to <b><i>loud noises, the natural aging process, illnesses, and genetic differences.</i></b> As people grow older, the likelihood of experiencing hearing loss increases, with approximately one-third of older individuals affected.</p>
