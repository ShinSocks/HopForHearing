            Hearing loss is one of the leading symptoms in the word. <u>60%</u> of adults in Canada have experienced some level of hearing loss. <br><br>Hearing loss severely affects everyday communication and conversations with loved ones, leading to other dangerous conditions such as <u>dementia, Alzheimer's disease, depression, and anxiety.</u><br><div id="inSupportJump"></div><br>More recently, hearing loss rates have also risen in children, affecting their ability to communicate with parents and learn.
